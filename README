Statistics::RVector version 0.1
====================

Statistics::RVector, known in short as RVector, is a Perl module 
with the intent of providing somewhat of a compatibility layer between
the R Stats programming language and Perl.  In the end, RVector is a 
vector library with vector math capabilities, and additionally supports 
statistical computation functions such as means, modes, standard 
deviation, and so forth.  However, as noted, the mechanics of this 
library are meant to mimic those of vectors in R.
